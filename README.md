# Linux-Bash-Scripting

Bash is one of the most common shells (unix shells). 
In this project is developed a bash script which:
```
1. Launches the Chromium browser, reads a list of urls and opens an appropriate number of tabs
2. Record the system resources consumed by Chromium processes
3. Ensure that all the processes of the above browser are terminated sequentially, and finally
4. Create graphs depicting the use of system resources while Chromium is running
```
